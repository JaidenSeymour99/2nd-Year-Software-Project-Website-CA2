# 2nd Software Project Gaming Website CA2 
 I design and create a web page for my second year CA2 using HTML, PHP, CSS, Photoshop and SQL

## Setup
Xampp version 7.0 needs to be downloaded and installed on your device, once installed turn on the apache and mysql servers. To load the database you will need to go to your browser and enter localhost/phpmyadmin into the search bar. create a new data base called gamestore_joshua then import a file. find the .sql file that is loacted in the CA2 -> Sql folder. and import the database. To load the web page type into the browser search bar localhost/CA2Complete/Source/ NOTE: with version 7.4 + of PHP the single game page will not work as one of the functions has been removed in current versions.
